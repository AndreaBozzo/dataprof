### 🚀 API Changes

#### New Python API

```python
import dataprof

# Single file analysis
profiles = dataprof.analyze_csv_file("data.csv")
report = dataprof.analyze_csv_with_quality("data.csv")

# Batch processing
result = dataprof.batch_analyze_directory("/data", recursive=True)
result = dataprof.batch_analyze_glob("/data/**/*.csv")
```

#### Enhanced Rust API

```rust
use dataprof::*;

// Streaming analysis
let report = analyze_csv_robust("large_file.csv")?;

// Batch processing
let processor = BatchProcessor::new();
let result = processor.process_directory(path)?;
```

#### New CLI Features

```bash
# Streaming mode for large files
dataprof --streaming --progress large_dataset.csv

# Batch processing
dataprof --recursive /data/warehouse/
dataprof --glob "**/*.csv" --parallel

# Advanced sampling
dataprof --sample 10000 huge_dataset.csv
```

### 📈 Performance Benchmarks

| Dataset Size | DataProfiler v0.3 | pandas.info() | Speedup |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| 1MB CSV      | 12ms             | 150ms         | 12.5x   |
| 10MB CSV     | 85ms             | 800ms         | 9.4x    |
| 100MB CSV    | 650ms            | 6.2s          | 9.5x    |
| 1GB CSV      | 4.2s             | 45s           | 10.7x   |

### 🔄 Migration Guide from v0.1

#### CLI Changes

- **No breaking changes** - all existing CLI commands work identically
- **New features** are opt-in with new flags (`--streaming`, `--parallel`, `--glob`)

#### Library Usage

- **New:** Import `dataprof` crate instead of building from source
- **Enhanced:** More comprehensive API with streaming and batch capabilities
- **Compatible:** Existing `analyze_csv()` function unchanged

### 🎯 Integration Examples

#### Airflow DAG Quality Gate

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
import dataprof

def quality_gate(**context):
    report = dataprof.analyze_csv_with_quality(context['params']['file'])
    if report.quality_score() < 80:
        raise ValueError(f"Quality too low: {report.quality_score()}")
```

#### Jupyter Data Exploration

```python
import dataprof
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

report = dataprof.analyze_csv_with_quality("dataset.csv")
print(f"Quality Score: {report.quality_score():.1f}%")

# Visualize null percentages
null_data = [(p.name, p.null_percentage) for p in report.column_profiles]
columns, percentages = zip(*null_data)
plt.bar(columns, percentages)
plt.title('Data Completeness by Column')
```
